Text: <p>The <u>bachelor thesis</u> is dedicated to the question of how we exist in cyberspace and what this can look like. </p><p>A video and an accompanying catalog present an interpretation of a 'virtual body' and draw attention to the lack of awareness of our movement in the virtual world and the 'digital traces' we leave behind.</p>
