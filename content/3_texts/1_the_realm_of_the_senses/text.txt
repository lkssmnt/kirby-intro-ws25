Text: <h1>The Realm of the Senses</h1><h2>Excerpt from Tactical Publishing – Using Senses, Software, and Archives in the Twenty-First Century by Alessandro Ludovico</h2><p>We are technically reading increasingly more today than we used to, mostly from our screens, and from an exponentially higher number of sources. There have been a few studies on the effects of reading on a screen compared to reading on paper, mostly involving the varied perception of time and space. In the study “Reading Linear Texts on Paper versus Computer Screen,”<sup>1</sup> it was shown that readers perform significantly worse when they have to reconstruct the timing of a story from a book on Amazon Kindle compared to a printed book, because the digital medium “does not provide the same support for mental reconstruction of a story as a print pocket book does.”<sup>2</sup> The perception of space is also challenged: in print it is mapped on a three-dimensional space with different reference points, but in digital it is mapped by a flat two-dimensional space with the additional layer of the graphical interface and its provided information as the only real reference point.</p><p>The time and space of reading are mainly determined by how we perceive the content and how we can process it. Jacques Derrida asserted this nearly a decade before the above mentioned study: “Paper is utilized in an experience involving the body, beginning with the hands, eyes, voice, ears; so it mobilizes both time and space.”<sup>3</sup> The involvement of our perceptual organs, and thus our senses, in a content that, being printed, requires a certain immersion, results in altering our space and time as the content tends to define them. But when reading paper we do not disconnect ourselves from the surroundings. In contrast, the use of multiple media on a flat portable screen can, on the one hand, fully capture our attention visually and aurally. But, on the other, it can freeze our gaze in an autonomously illuminated dimension that lacks deep engagement and proclaims its inadequacy.<sup>4</sup></p><p>The main question would be to understand what it means for our bodies and brains to read from screen and, in comparison, what it means to read from paper. To narrow down this question, it is significant to grasp how our different senses are involved in reading in each environment and to find significant elements that show how the whole reading experience takes place.</p><h2>The Touching Simulation of Print</h2><p>Printed media have a historically entrenched visual infrastructure, constructed primarily around the concept of a single unit of content, usually a page, and refined through centuries of visual culture.</p><p>The visual part of print is seemingly predominant over the involvement of the other senses, and it is the only one that does not require physical involvement through chemical (smell and even taste), material (touch), or vibrational (hearing) means. In our society, shaped by ocular centrism, this visual part has been increasingly, and very mistakenly, perceived as coinciding with the whole.</p><p>This seems to be the main reason why printed media are in the process of being massively translated through direct processes of optical rendering into another universal medium, the digital, which is mostly visually driven. Since print is perceived primarily visually, it is being completely reduced to its purely optical qualities, both by scanning and consequent release of files in specific formats, which circulate through overwhelmingly optical media and supporting networks. What is missing in this translation is much more than nostalgia for the traditional physical medium: it is a whole little perceptual universe that instinctually unfolds and is enjoyed every time the printed medium is used in a slightly different way, while being misdirected, if not richly negated, in its new universal screen-based embodiments. The main problem with this translation is the lack of specificity in the resulting rendition by the new medium, as the content we see on the screen is consistent with what we see on paper only optically, with a digital interface and a set of additional services. Thus, what we perceive digitally is a “simulation” of what we perceive on paper with very similar visual archetypes. This simulation is a complex process, in which the reader participates by executing code and processes that reenact the system used in print.<sup>5</sup> And this simulation is based on a computer, defined by Jeremy Shapiro as “practically and theoretically a simulation machine,” a definition that we can also easily extend to mobile computing devices, which can perform the same quality of simulations as traditional computers.<sup>6</sup> The act of digitizing a piece of content can, thus, legitimately be interpreted as an act of simulation, and the digitized content, in this case printed content, as a dynamic simulation of a static copy. We can then assume that when we read a digital publication, we are reading a simulation of it, through a structurally different medium that is capable of hosting, representing, and transmitting it. Consequently, we can expect our senses to cope in a different way with this simulated environment and to adapt accordingly to its properties and modalities.</p><h2>The Digital Reading Experience in Smell, Hearing, and Sight</h2><p>The general discourse on digital forms of print emphasizes above all its extreme flexibility, which derives from its innate computability. What we see on-screen is the result of information calculated each time it is visualized, technically rendered from a coded set of acquired data. A digital publication can be carried around in an infinitesimal digital storage space, and it can be accessed, thus rendered, adapting to the display used, with a consequent set of versatile functions applicable to its data structure. To name a few: it can be searched through precise and composite queries, comprehensively analyzed through calculated quantification of its semiotic properties, and literally expanded in scope through links to external content of any kind, eventually cross-referencing the original text.</p><p>But all these instant qualities in the digital come at a cost traditionally underestimated: a completely different reading experience, compared to the models derived from print culture, determined mainly by a different balance in the involvement of our senses—or, as Marshall McLuhan defined it, the “knowledge of the changing sense ratios affected by various externalisations of our senses.”<sup>7</sup> Today, apart from the limited resurgence of analog media, this externalization is articulated primarily through a single underlying digital medium, which computes and sends any information, encoded and quantified in numbers, to the target screen of choice anywhere in the world. McLuhan helps to understand this epochal change through his perfected concept: “The effects of technology [. . .] alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance.”<sup>8</sup> This alteration, coupled with the absence of resistance, foresees our current sensory attempts to cope with the multiplication of endless information models.</p><p>Let us consider, then, the differences between print and digital reading experiences from a perceptual perspective worthy of sense-by-sense analysis. We can reasonably argue that digital content primarily uses one sense, vision, which is involved in interpreting its primary physical interface, the screen, which will be analyzed later. It is equally important to analyze the sense of smell, the sense of hearing, and the sense of sight and understand what contribution each makes to the overall experience. This is the necessary precondition to examining not only the intrinsic tactility of printed content but more importantly what we can tentatively define as the “material space of information” and the immediate consequences this has for publishing.</p><h3>Smell</h3><p>This sense has been conceptually almost absent from digital media. We can consider smell in this context from two leading perspectives: the smell of the medium and the smell of the content. The former propagates from the hardware, and it is briefly present when the reader device is very new, due to the initial heating of plastic and electronics, vanishing over time. In a study of users’ perceptions of computer smell over the last few decades, it is shown that there has been a striking decline in its perception, due to several factors, including the use of improved technology. The study concludes that: “information technology becomes more and more ‘deodorised.’”<sup>9</sup> It is worth noting that, even if we were able to perceive some sort of smell associated with the device, that smell would always, and consistently, be the same for this entire class of devices. It would then be the same smell associated with each piece of content, and especially with each publication viewed on it, which would make it useless for appreciating their differences, since it would break the strong connection our senses</p><p>are physically predisposed to make between the two different elements: a specific content and a specific smell. Thus, a consistent single underlying smell would denature the original content after digitization, in a lossy process. This process is a direct result of the digitization, which makes it possible to have almost infinite content on a single medium. The collapse of the content space into a single device, namely a “container,” flattens the original physical qualities of the various publications and their senseoriented properties, reinforcing efforts to render them mainly visually.</p><p>From a pure content perspective, on the other hand, there are few strategies to compensate for the complete absence of smells in digital content. Some companies have attempted to synthesize smells as part of the increased commercial goal of producing “augmented digital books,” but additional equipment is needed to produce them. For example, Vapour Communication built a prototype of what they called “oBook” for their title Goldilocks and the Three Bears: The Smelly Version, an e-book that would incorporate various synthetic smells such as flowers, berries, and hot chocolate, among others.<sup>10</sup> At certain points in the story they are activated by “scent buttons” on the interface that trigger an external device, the “oPhone,” to emit the respective prefabricated scents. This scent simulation solidifies the innate aseptic role of the digital, which requires another specialized hardware component to cope with a domain that is not purely visual. And the inevitable approach is to digitize this kind of information as well, to abstract it, and to make it universally identical for every user. This approach inevitably leads to the loss of the possible subtle or distinctive differences that are instead present in organic counterparts; it is these distinctions that allow for a more nuanced and less standardized reading experience. To note this aseptic quality, there is a well-known work that notes the loss of smell in the digital reading experience. It is the conceptual fake website that purports to sell its “Smell of Books™” spray cans with scents like “New Book Smell” or “Classic Musty Smell,” advertised as a product to help e-book customers feel “more comfortable with their devices.”<sup>11</sup> This irony still exists, even though expensive devices capable of synthesizing or “generating” a very limited number of scents by automatically combining basic elements have come on the market over the years.<sup>12</sup> A reliable and sophisticated synthetic scent machine is far from being built and commercialized. With the same kind of satire, even Google concocted an April Fools’ Day joke in 2008, with a press release announcing an improvement to its Google Books search technology capable of rendering scents of “scratch and sniff” books such as The Cheese Companion or Gorillas in the Mist through a web browser.<sup>13</sup> These ironic strategies of ridiculing the need for a specific sensory enhancement of the digital media reveal the technically and conceptually unfeasible expectation of involving our sense of smell in digital content fruition, and especially in our reading experience. Print, in contrast, is probably the analog medium that has included smell the most, both accidentally with its own material decay and programmatically with workarounds to preserve the ephemerality of olfactory compounds. Digital media content does not even smell conceptually. This is largely because its calculated and ephemerally shifting nature of numbers converted to light on the screen structurally dismantles the other slow timing or persistence that smells require.</p><h3>Hearing</h3><p>If the presence of smell can be easily detected, hearing may or may not be involved in reading digital publications. Digital audiobooks have become a popular product, thanks to their immediate digital distribution, giving the opportunity to anybody, from celebrities to random people, to produce and sell them. As a reading experience, I would tentatively associate them more with the radio paradigm than with the traditional publishing one. But they have become a standard format, increasingly available with the use of synthetic voices automatically reading texts and have started to give enormous accessibility of content to the visually impaired.</p><p>Nonetheless, in classic digital publishing hearing is involved both externally and internally. Content and software companies still implement a simulation of our gestures to turn pages, so hearing is externally involved in the functional sounds induced by our hands to functionally progress in reading. For example, the click of the mouse/trackpad/keyboard/buttons to increase or decrease brightness, the subtle swipe of fingers on the trackpad, or the gentle tap on the smartphone screen. Our upper limbs, and the body as a whole, are involved as a mechanical instrument to coordinate with the space and time dictated by the machine to relate to its content, and the sounds produced as a result are equally operational and universally abstract. As Anne Mangen and Adriaan van der Weel have pointed out: “The transition from reading on paper to reading on screens reveals the role of the body in reading.”<sup>14</sup> We then understand that this role changes in relation to digital screens, in that they become purely functional in the operationality of the machine, and this pure functionality becomes even more evident when compared to the opposite and luxurious multisensory nature of paper, which I will analyze later on.</p><p>Inside the machine, sounds are generated by the system of digital interfaces. There has never been a sufficiently standardized interface for digital publications, except for the reading software of Kindle devices. But there are a plethora of open and proprietary software systems that deal with different document formats and lead to just as many concepts of engagement with digital content. Hearing is generally stimulated by the interface for two different purposes. One is to better simulate the physical experience and compensate for the lack of sound that results from the physical manipulation of print. Typically, the interface restricts its aural domains in this regard by triggering a single sound sample as the user virtually turns the pages. It is a single one that is repeated each time, and once our ear is trained to recognize it, it fades into the background, bringing no further information to our reading experience but merely confirming through audio feedback that the page turning request has been fulfilled as a classic predictable universal cause-effect relationship. Its role is that of a predefined “page-turning audio cue,”<sup>15</sup> which simply annotates with a predefined tone what is visually attended to and expected.</p><p>The other purpose of sounds in this context is to warn the user about a system-related event using alert sounds that are still integrated into the overall construct of the interface. Conceptually, these sounds do not belong to the reading practice itself but to the underlying software infrastructure. Thus, they relate to the metalevel of the interaction but have nothing to do with to the content. In fact, they are usually intended to draw attention to an impeding disturbance or to warn of something, and then, paradoxically, their role is to distract from reading by focusing on a machine-related event. Sound does not contribute appreciably to the experience of digital reading but is being used as artificial and universal feedback or as a trigger to divert attention from the content. Because it is almost exclusively tied to the interface, it is operational, never descriptive.</p><h3>Sight</h3><p>Sight is heavily involved in digital reading because the entire system is designed around what is happening on the screen and its predominantly visual interface. The digital’s main property of flattening differences to achieve a general understanding is also reflected in sight. The reduction to digital, through the process of digitization, means that information is abstracted to a universal status, ubiquitously replicable on screen-based devices everywhere.</p><p>Thus, text appears consistently and ubiquitously in different spaces and times, with slightly altered brightness and contrast. These changes were even cancelled out by e-ink screens, which consist of half-white and half-black tiny spheres that guarantee contrast but also complete uniformity of pages. They are still used in e-readers, but all other screens we use have the classic retro-lit screen, the backlight, which ensures readability regardless of external lighting conditions, that is, anytime, anywhere, and that usually automatically adjusts to the environment, including the “night shift mode” that changes the colors of the screen to warmer light by subtracting the blue component to have less impact on the circadian rhythm of the viewer. But as with every other element of the human-machine interface, this is a universal behavior that switches to the same hues in every corner of the world at a given local time. The general backlighting paradigm is self-referential and focuses attention on the screen as the main source of content. It largely ignores the possible differences of what surrounds it, such as other forms of dim light, colors, reflections, and, in a sense, cuts them out with its light emissions.</p><p>We look directly at the screen, where the space of the page is replicated to match its size, and whose technical properties determine the status of all our digital reading for each piece of content. With the digital, the screen is the universal medium for any content produced in any time, space, and condition, for nondisabled people, of course. The multiple properties of the content (age, place of production, decay, size) are flattened to the matrix of available pixels, and its calculated and/or reproduced design is the only dimension worth mentioning. The software’s scan or rendering of the page becomes its clean universal representation in a perpetual frozen state in which it no longer changes or deteriorates in any way but becomes the iconic, idealized version of what we used to know as publications.</p><p>Sight is then captured by the light and flattened by the character of this universal representational modality and becomes the only sufficient source of information about the content.</p><ol><li><p>Anne Mangen, Bente R.
